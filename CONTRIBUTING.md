# Contributing to Lovebecile-Hairs

I love it when a community comes together to make things "better," and as such, this repository is open to contributions. These can be as simple as;

- Reporting an issue
- Discussing the current state of the respostiory
- Submitting a fix to an issue
- Making requests for textures

## It's developed with GIT and GITHUB

I know it's weird to have a texture respository on github of all platforms, but I needed something robux. As such, we use this platform to keep track of;
- Issues
- Requests
- Pull requests

## The Workflow

If you've never used github, here's the workflow for contributing;

- **Read this documentation fully.**
- Fork the repository
- If you're adding new textures, ensure the folder structure mimics what is in the [README.md](./README.md) file.
- If you're revising textures, **do not modify the original texture.** Instead, make a new folder for your texture and clarify that it is revised.
- Make sure your texture files are apropriately exported and formatted. It is preferred you export your texture files as .png files.
- Make sure that the name of the texture is appropriate.
- Once all is done, you can create a [pull request](https://github.com/CodingWithAnxiety/Lovebecile-Hairs/compare).

## Report issues using Github's [issues](https://github.com/CodingWithAnxiety/Lovebecile-Hairs/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track any issues with textures. Report an issue by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/CodingWithAnxiety/Lovebecile-Hairs/issues/new).

**Great Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

People *love* thorough bug reports.
