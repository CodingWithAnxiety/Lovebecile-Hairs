## Rendering takes time

I render all of the models by hand, and often times this can take five minutes an image. For this reason, *I do not accept render comissions at this time, and do not render the hairs with male hairs.* 

I do **NOT** make the models that I use in renders. If you own one of the models used for hair renders, you can contact me and I will remove the offending images and models.
